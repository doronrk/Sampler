TODO:
    - GUI side
        - Allow user to select duration value of sample, per each sample
        - Display/highlight the subsection of the sample that is currently being
        rendered
            - remember, this subsection depends on:
                - bpm, duration, current note
        - Allow user to select root-note for each sample

    - Idea to avoid drift
        - record the ppqPosition when the note begins
        - if duration is a 1/4 note, should recycle at origin ppq + 1


Problems:
    crashes Live when aif dropped 
    case where bpm is changed after start note not handled
