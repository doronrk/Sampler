TODO:
    - GUI side
        - Select num voices
        - Select sync duration
        - Select sustain mode
        - Select start sample
        - Select root-note

    - Idea to avoid drift
        - record the ppqPosition when the note begins
        - if duration is a 1/4 note, should recycle at origin ppq + 1


Problems:
    crashes Live when aif dropped 
    case where bpm is changed after start note not handled
