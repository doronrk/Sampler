Description:
    In sync-mode, this plug-in normalizes the playback duration of each note. 
    This is implemented by dynamically calculating the sample end for every voice according to pitch.
    For example, lower pitches yield an end sample closer to the start sample since lower pitches move through the sample more slowly.
    High pitches yield an end sample further from the start sample since high pitches move through the sample more quickly.

    Consider a sample with root note C3, sample rate of 44100, and total length 88200 samples. Let's assume the DAW is set to 60 bpm.
    In sync-mode, with duration set to .5 (a half note), playing C3 will begin at sample 0, and end at sample 22050.
    With duration set to 1.0, playing C3 will begin at sample 0, and end at sample 44100.
    With duration set to 1.0, playing C2 will begin at sample 0, and end at sample 22050.
    With duration set to 1.0, playing C4 will begin at sample 0, and end at sample 88200.
    Notice that notes above C4 cannot be rendered in sync-mode with duration set to 1.0 because syncing the playback duration in this case requires more samples than the total length of the sample


Features needed:
    explicit warning/handling of the case where a MIDI note requires more samples than are available in sync mode
    select start sample by clicking on sample region

Bugs:
    crashes Live when aif dropped 
    case where bpm is changed after start note not handled
